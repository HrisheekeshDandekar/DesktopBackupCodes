I have no idea where to start
1. Try examining the binary with a reverse engineering platform.

I still have no idea what to do
2. Try creating your own go binaries and analyzing how they work.

Internal Notes
Golang binaries always put user-defined functions at the very end. 
Analyzing the call instructions you will get a small list of functions. 
One of the functions has data and an xor. 
Go to the data, write the data out into a string, and xor it with 0x8 to get the flag.
